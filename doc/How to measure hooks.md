#How to measure hooks

Hooks are arranged in longitudinal rows. One longitudinal row is highlighted in the image above. To create a meristogram we need measurements from each of the hooks in at least one longitudinal row of hooks per specimen.

##Preparation of material
On removal from the host, acanthocephalans should be washed and relaxed in distilled water, then fixed in 70% ethanol. All acanthocephalans should be prepared for light microscopy using the same protocol. I recommend dehydrating the specimens in an alcohol series and then clearing and mounting in lactophenol.

##Light microscopy
Select a longitudinal row in which all hooks are visible in profile.

##Measurements
From each hook in your selected row record two measurements: length (L) and base (B).

Hook measurements should be entered into a spreadsheet and then save as a comma separated value (CSV) file:
