# Meristogram
[R](http://www.r-project.org) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) implementation of Prof David Huffman's meristogram. The meristogram provides a graphical representation of serial variation in hook morphology along the [acanthocephalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthocephala) proboscis. The method is also applicable to other animals possessing serially repeating structures.

Detailed instructions on how to collect data can be found in [How to measure hooks](https://github.com/WaylandM/meristogram/blob/master/doc/How%20to%20measure%20hooks.md).
