#Meristogram
[R](http://www.r-project.org) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) implementation of Prof David Huffman's meristogram. The meristogram provides a graphical representation of serial variation in hook morphology along the [acanthocephalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthocephala) proboscis. The method is also applicable to other animals possessing serially repeating structures. 

The meristogram algorithm is implemented in [R](http://www.r-project.org). A simple to use graphical user interface (GUI) has been implemented using [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). However, there is also a command line interface (CLI) for users with some experience of [R](http://www.r-project.org).
