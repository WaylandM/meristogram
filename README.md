#Meristogram
[R](http://www.r-project.org) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) implementation of Prof David Huffman's meristogram. The meristogram provides a graphical representation of serial variation in hook morphology along the [acanthocephalan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthocephala) proboscis. The method is also applicable to other animals possessing serially repeating structures. A simple to use, graphical user interface (GUI) is provided. A command line interface (CLI) is also available for those with some experience of using [R](http://www.r-project.org).
